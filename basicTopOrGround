//So Basically working on to how can we manage the elevator systen in the fastest and the most efficient way to travel accross the buildings
//This is a basic code that only allows user to give results based on whether they want to go to the top floor or the bottom floor
//Next step towards development of this code would be to take an input where the passenger wants to go before they even board in the evelvator
//to be continued...
